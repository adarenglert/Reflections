2.having access to all history of a file is convient because
 you don't always know when you make the mistake, so you can
just scroll to the past and see, the exact moment which the 
error occured.
3. the pros are that you can choose the size of the intervals
between the commits' whether it too big or too small change.
the cons are that it's based on user actions and can be highly
affected by user errors.
4.when coding, most of the time you use a multiple files that
connected one to another, so when you change 1 file you changed
probalby changed the relation and so you changed the other file
as well.
in the other platforms' most of the time you modify only 1 file
at a time, so it's not nessecery to save multiply files versions.
5.you shold use git log for getting the log of all the changes of
the file, and git diff for comparing the last change to the original 
content.
6. because you know that if something will go wrong you can always 
go back and see what was the origin of the problem.
